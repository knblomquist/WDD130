         <h1>if statements</h1>
        <p>
          sometimes you want something to happen only some of the time, in times like that you use
          what is called an if statement. It looks like this if(): and then the code is on the next line
          indented, everything indented is inside this if statement. In the parenthesis you put the
          condition that will cause the code inside the if stament to occure only if the condition is true
          when filled it will look something like this
        </p>
        <p>
          let's look at some real world examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          if you want to cross the road you wouldn't just cross without checking first, but what would
          determine if you would cross the street or not? a few examples might be, is there a car coming
          is the cross walk light on, is there a stop sign? these are just a few examples of things you might
          think about before crossing the street.
        </p>

          now the conditions will where you are comparing if 2 things are equal, you wouldn't just use =, but rather
          you would use == dont think about it too much and just accept it.
