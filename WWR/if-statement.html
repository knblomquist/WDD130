            <h3>basics</h3>
      <p>
        the basics for for programming usually starts at the same place, with a simple program 
        called hello world
      </p>
      <p>
        Hello World! is a program that simply shows the user text showing "Hello World!" you use 
        what is called a print statement for this.
      </p>
      <p>
        a print statement looks like this print(). Inside the parenthesis you put in quotations what
        you want the computer to show the user. Think for a second what it would look like if you wanted
        to print Hello World! hover over the image to see the answer

      </ul>
      <h1>if statements</h1>
      <p>
        sometimes you want something to happen only some of the time, in times like that you use
        what is called an if statement. It looks like this if(): and then the code is on the next line
        indented, everything indented is inside this if statement. In the parenthesis you put the
        condition that will cause the code inside the if stament to occure only if the condition is true
        when filled it will look something like this
      </p>
      <p>
        let's look at some real world examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        if you want to cross the road you wouldn't just cross without checking first, but what would
        determine if you would cross the street or not? a few examples might be, is there a car coming
        is the cross walk light on, is there a stop sign? these are just a few examples of things you might
        think about before crossing the street.
      </p>
      <p>
        now the conditions will where you are comparing if 2 things are equal, you wouldn't just use =, but rather
        you would use == dont think about it too much and just accept it.
